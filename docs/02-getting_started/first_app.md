Ever want to have a Vercel-style experience when creating your nextjs app?
But without the limitation to a specific vendor?
In this doc, we will show you how to create a nextjs app in Vercel style with an open source, cloud native stack.

## List all stacks

List all default stacks:

```shell
hln list stacks
```

Output:

```shell
NAME      VERSION  DESCRIPTION
sample    0.0.1
gin-next  0.0.1
gin-vue   0.0.1
```

## Create your application

Create your application interactively:

```shell
hln up -s sample -i
```

Input the values one by one according to the promt:

> Note: APP_NAME should obey the rules in [DNS1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123)

```shell
Name of your application (required):

> hello-world

Path to your kubeconfig file (required):

> ~/.kube/config

Which github organization do you want to use? (required):

> organization name or github id
```

Then it will start executing the setup instructions. Output looks like:

:::tip

If `hln up` command failed due to unexpected network problems, feel free to **rerun** it again.

:::

Congrats! You have created your first application with `hln` successfully. All of the cloud-native architecture have been set up properly.
Click the GitHub url and dashboard links to see the effects.

Get application status:

```shell
hln status
```

Output looks like:

## See the effects

Get your ingress IP:

<Tabs
className="unique-tabs"
defaultValue="local"
values={[
{label: 'Kind/Minikube', value: 'local'},
{label: 'Cloud', value: 'cloud'},
]}>

<TabItem value="local">

```shell
127.0.0.1
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cloud">

```shell
kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc ingress-nginx-controller -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Put the following lines into your `/etc/hosts` (replace <ingress-ip\> with above result):

```txt
<ingress-ip> argocd.h8r.site
<ingress-ip> hello-world-frontend.h8r.site
```

Check your **ArgoCD** dashboard at [argocd.h8r.site](http://argocd.h8r.site), Get argocd credentials with `hln status` command:

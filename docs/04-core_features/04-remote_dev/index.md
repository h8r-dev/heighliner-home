Your app created via Heighliner stacks will have Remote Debug solution.
By default, we will use Nocalhost to setup remote development environment and support remote debugging.

## Nocalhost Dashboard

In Heighliner, a stack will normally setup the Nocalhost server.
You can get the Nocalhost dashboard url, default user account and passwords via `hln status <app>` command.

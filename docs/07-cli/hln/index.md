## What is hln?

_hln_ is a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to create your application from a particular [stack](/docs/core_features/stack/).

_hln_ CLI has the ability of searching and downloading stacks from [stackhub](../../01-overview/arch.md#heighliner-stackhub), creating application with  particular stack, developing and monitoring the created applications.

## How Does hln Work?

With the help of _hln_ CLI, all you need to do is to choose a stack and prepare some arguments such as your application name, the kubeconfig of your cluster, etc. Then you can spin up your application with a single command `hln up -i` and provide the input values interactively. Wait several minutes and everything will be done by _hln_.

Under the hood, _hln_ relies on two core concepts, [stack](/docs/core_features/stack/) and [dagger](https://dagger.io/). Stack is the sketch of your application, which describes what does your application look like. Dagger is the executing engine of our stack. It can read the stack firstly, then fill in the customize input values and generate a real application for you.
